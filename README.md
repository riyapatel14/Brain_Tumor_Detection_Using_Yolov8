# Brain Tumor Detection using YOLOv8

## Overview

This project leverages YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm, to detect brain tumors in MRI images. The system is designed to enhance medical imaging analysis capabilities using advanced deep learning techniques.

## Features

- *Real-time Detection*: Achieves real-time tumor detection in MRI images.
- *High Accuracy*: YOLOv8 ensures high accuracy in identifying and classifying brain tumors.
- *Versatility*: Can be deployed in various medical environments, including hospitals and research facilities.
- *Scalability*: Designed to handle large volumes of MRI image data for continuous monitoring and analysis.

## How It Works

1. *Object Detection*: YOLOv8 detects brain tumors in MRI images.
2. *Tumor Classification*: Identifies and classifies the detected tumors.
3. *Visualization*: Outputs the MRI image with detected tumors and their classifications.
